"""A Gymnasium-style environment over the engine.

        action = agent(obs, info["mask"])
        obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

Three things this layer decides, none of which belong in the rules:

**The dice are rolled for you.** :func:`catan.rules.roll_dice` is environment
stochasticity, not a move, so ``step`` rolls automatically whenever the game is waiting on
one — after applying an action and before returning the next observation. An agent never
sees a state where its only option is "roll". The one exception is a Knight played *before*
the roll: that is a real choice — it decides which tile pays out this turn — so if it is
available the environment stops and offers it.

**Whoever must act is the observer.** Catan is not strictly alternating: during a discard the
decision belongs to whoever is over the hand limit, usually an opponent. So every step
returns ``info["player"]`` and the observation is built from *that* player's view. A self-play
loop should read it rather than assume turn order — this is the usual source of bugs in
multi-agent environments.

**Rewards are terminal and zero-sum.** ``+1`` for the winner, ``-1`` for everyone else, 0
while the game runs. Reward is attributed to the player who *acted*, which for a
zero-sum-at-the-end game is all the signal there is; shaping is a training decision, not an
environment one, so it is left to the caller.

Truncation is separate from termination: a game stopped at ``max_turns`` reports
``truncated=True`` with no winner, which a learner must treat differently from a loss.
