"""Self-play across processes.

The engine is pure Python, so one process uses one core of twenty. This module is the same
answer :mod:`training.parallel` gives the PPO trainer, and it inherits the same three traps —
recorded here rather than referred to, because each of them fails quietly.

**Windows spawns rather than forks.** Every child re-imports this module, so the worker
functions must be module-level and everything crossing the boundary must be picklable.
Nothing is inherited: each child builds its own network from a config and its own generator
from a seed.

**Thread oversubscription is the usual way to make this slower.** Torch sizes its OpenMP pool
at *import*, and reports 14 threads on this machine, so fourteen workers would ask for 196
threads on 20 cores and spend their lives in the scheduler. Children are pinned to one thread
each by setting the environment before the pool is created — a child inherits ``os.environ``
at spawn time, and the parent has already built its own pool by then, so the parent keeps the
wide setting it wants for the gradient step.

**Generators are persistent inside each worker.** Games are kept in flight between
iterations. A worker that dropped its unfinished games would throw away most of its work,
because a game is 100-plus decisions and an iteration is a few thousand positions per worker.
The consequence is that the *first* iteration is slower than the rest — the pipeline is still
filling — so a benchmark that does not warm up measures the wrong thing. ``CLAUDE.md`` records
an earlier version of this project reporting 4 workers as faster than 8 for exactly that
reason.

Only the learner's weights cross the boundary each iteration: 780 KB, against the tens of
megabytes of samples coming back.

    claimed from a queue rather than derived from the process id so that the *set* of games a
