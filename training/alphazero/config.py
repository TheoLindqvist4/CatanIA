"""The run's settings, and where they are read from.

The guide specifies ``configs/train.yaml``, and that is what this reads — but PyYAML is not
a dependency of this project and adding one for a file of twenty ``key: value`` lines is a
poor trade. So :func:`load_config` parses the subset the guide's example actually uses: flat
scalars, ``#`` comments, and nothing nested. A file that uses more than that is **rejected
with the offending line**, rather than half-parsed into a config that is quietly wrong — a
training run misconfigured by a silently dropped key is a wasted afternoon that looks like a
bad idea.

Defaults live in :data:`DEFAULTS`, so a missing key is never a crash and the YAML is a set of
overrides rather than a required document.

    # visit counts, which lean on Q far more weakly, survive it better.

    # The in-loop check is deliberately cheap and deliberately measures the *network*, not
    # the searcher. `play_match` is sequential and a searching agent evaluates the network
    # once per simulation at batch 1, so 200 games at 32 simulations costs about thirteen
    # minutes — which, every six iterations, is most of a training run. At 0 simulations the
    # agent plays its raw policy, which is one forward pass a move and takes about 40
    # seconds; that still answers the only question the loop needs answered, which is whether
    # the network is getting better.
    #
    # Whether the *search* helps is a different question, and it is answered once, properly,
    # by the promotion gate at `promotion_simulations`.
    #
    # ⚠️ `evaluate_every: 0` switches the in-loop check **off**, and that is the default,
    # because the number it produces is one CLAUDE.md already says not to act on. It scores
    # the *raw policy*, which has twice been measured moving in the opposite direction to
    # search-ranked strength — one run read 62.5 -> 60.4 -> 50.5 -> 51.0 and looked finished,
    # while the arena put its last checkpoint first and its "peak" last.
    #
    # It is not free. Measured from five runs' own metrics.jsonl, by differencing the
    # unaccounted residual on evaluating iterations against non-evaluating ones:
    #
    #     az_run_1h        4 evaluations   21.0 s each   2.33% of the run
    #     az_run_1h_b      4               16.8 s        1.87%
    #     az_run_2h        9               19.2 s        2.40%
    #     az_stage1_run    4               19.9 s        3.62%
    #     az_stage2_run    5               29.2 s        4.38%
    #
    # and it is *idle* time: the parent plays 200 sequential games at batch 1 while all
    # fourteen workers wait. Off, the run snapshots instead (`Trainer.snapshot`) and
    # `training/alphazero/arena.py` ranks the snapshots afterwards with search, which is the
    # only ranking this repository considers evidence.

    # 2-4% and cannot be read as progress.

    #: the heuristic it is not affected by rule changes. Both sides run at `eval_simulations`,
    #: so at 0 this is an honest network-against-network comparison; it is still the raw
