"""The network AlphaZero trains, and how it is started.

Not a new architecture. :class:`~training.structured_net.StructuredPolicyValueNet` already
produces exactly what AlphaZero needs — one logit per action laid out by board element, and
one value — and it is already the structure-aware model the guide asks for: 19 tiles, 54
vertices and 72 roads embedded by shared per-entity MLPs, with neighbourhood information
carried by constant incidence matrices from :mod:`catan.topology`. That *is* a graph network
over the Catan graph; it simply exploits the graph being the same in every game to do the
message passing as a matmul against a constant instead of a gather.

Two things are different here.

**The value head is bounded.** AlphaZero's target is exactly ``+1``/``-1`` and the loss is a
mean square error, so ``tanh`` is applied — see ``value_activation`` on the network.

**The run is warm-started, not started.** A cold AlphaZero net plays randomly, and at the
simulation counts a 20-core CPU can afford, random self-play produces a policy target barely
better than its own prior. The repository already contains a policy that beats the heuristic
about 71% of the time. :func:`graft` carries those weights onto the current observation, so
search begins as *policy improvement over something that already plays*, which is the regime
AlphaZero is strong in. Recorded as a deliberate departure from "learns entirely from
self-play" in ``docs/decisions/0023-alphazero-self-play.md``.

**Why a graft is needed at all.** ``models/champion.pt`` was promoted when
``encoder.SIZE`` was 1868. The affordability block added 16 floats at offset 1773, so the
encoder is now 1884 and the champion no longer loads — ``training.champion.load()`` returns
``None`` today, which is why the interfaces currently offer no learned opponent. Only one
tensor is the wrong shape: the first layer of ``context_mlp``, whose input is the
un-positional tail of the observation. Every other parameter is untouched by the change,
because the tiles/vertices/roads encoders read fixed-width rows and the affordability block
is not one of them.

The 16 new columns are inserted **as zeros**. That is the whole reason this is safe rather
than a guess: a zero column contributes nothing, so the grafted network computes the same
function as the original on the same position, and the new features start neutral and are
learned. :func:`graft` returns the number of columns it inserted so a caller can refuse a
checkpoint it does not understand instead of silently mangling one.

      error (MAE 0.1121 -> 0.0554) for +37k parameters, while policy agreement barely moved.
