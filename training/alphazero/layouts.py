"""What the observation looked like at each size it has ever had.

A checkpoint records the number of floats it was trained on and nothing else, which is enough
to *detect* an observation change and not enough to *survive* one: reconciling weights needs
to know which block grew and by how much, and 1,884 does not say.

So two things live here. New checkpoints carry their layout — :func:`signature` — and are
self-describing forever. Checkpoints written before that existed are looked up in
:data:`HISTORICAL`, which is a short table because this project has had few observations, and
which must **never be edited retroactively**: an entry is a statement about a file that
already exists on disk.

Adding a block, or widening one, means appending a new entry keyed by the new
:data:`catan.encoder.SIZE`. Nothing else. If the size is not in the table and the checkpoint
does not carry its own layout, grafting refuses rather than guesses — a wrong guess produces a
network that loads, runs, and plays nonsense.
