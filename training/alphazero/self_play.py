"""Generating games, and the positions learned from them.

One self-play game is a loop of "search, play the most-visited move, repeat", and the naive
version of that runs the network once per simulation at batch 1. Measured on this machine
the structured network does 3,133 evaluations a second at batch 1 and 22,391 at batch 32 —
the same arithmetic, seven times the throughput, because a batch-1 matmul spends its life in
call overhead rather than in FLOPs.

So a worker does **not** play one game at a time. :class:`Generator` keeps ``width`` games in
flight, asks each of their searches for a position to evaluate, evaluates all of them in one
forward pass, and hands the answers back. The games are otherwise completely independent —
different boards, different seeds, no shared tree — and they drift out of step with each
other immediately, which is fine and in fact helps: a batch then contains positions from
every stage of a game rather than 32 openings.

**What is recorded.** One sample per *searched* decision: the observation from the mover's
point of view, the legality mask, the visit-count distribution as the policy target, and —
once the game ends — that mover's result as the value target. Forced moves are skipped: their
policy target is a one-hot over a single option and carries no information, and they are about
a third of all decisions.

**Both seats are recorded from every game.** Catan's env reports a reward for the player who
just acted and the winner is always that player (``CLAUDE.md``), so a learner that used the
returned reward would train on winners only. Value targets here are written from
``info["winner"]`` against each sample's own mover.

**Temperature.** The guide's schedule: 1.0 for the opening, then near-greedy. Sampling in the
opening is what produces different games from the same network; without it a deterministic
policy plays one game per board and the buffer fills with copies.
