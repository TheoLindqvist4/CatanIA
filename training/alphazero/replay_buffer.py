"""Where self-play positions live between being generated and being learned from.

The guide asks for two million positions and for sampling stratified by age. Two million is
not affordable here and the reason is arithmetic rather than taste: an observation is 1,884
floats, so two million of them is 15 GB in float32 on a machine that also has to hold twenty
worker processes. Three things bring it into range.

**Observations are stored as float16.** Halves the bill. The encoder emits counts, ratios and
flags — nothing outside float16's exact-integer range of 2048 and nothing that needs more
than three significant digits, which ``tests/test_alphazero.py`` checks by round-tripping a
real observation.

**Policy targets are stored sparsely.** A visit-count distribution over 325 actions after 48
simulations has at most 48 non-zero entries and usually under a dozen. Keeping the top
:data:`POLICY_TOP_K` and renormalising costs 128 bytes instead of 1,300, and drops only
entries a single visit apart from zero.

**The buffer is sized to the run.** The default holds :data:`DEFAULT_CAPACITY` positions,
about 850 MB, which is several times what a three-hour run on twenty cores produces — so for
that run the ring never wraps and "stratified by age" spans the whole history.

Sampling follows the guide: the buffer is cut into four equal age bands and a batch is drawn
in equal parts from each. Uniform sampling over a ring that is being appended to at speed is
biased toward the newest data exactly when the newest data is the most correlated — every
position in a game shares one outcome, so a batch drawn from one iteration is a batch of a
few dozen games seen 300 times. Banding by age is the cheap fix, and unlike a priority scheme
it needs no bookkeeping per sample.
