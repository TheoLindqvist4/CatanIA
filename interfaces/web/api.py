"""The game as plain dictionaries — no HTTP, no framework.

Every decision the web interface makes happens here, in Python, where it can be tested.
:mod:`interfaces.web.server` is a thin shim that maps URLs onto these functions; swapping it
for FastAPI or Flask would touch nothing in this module.

**Hidden information is filtered here, on the way out.** If an opponent's hand reaches the
JSON it reaches the browser, and someone will read it. :func:`view` is the only function that
builds a response, so it is the only place that has to get this right —
``tests/test_web_api.py`` asserts no response ever carries an opponent's cards.

**The client renders and reports clicks; it decides nothing.** No legality, no board
generation. The last time this project had board logic in JavaScript it was a second
implementation that could disagree with the engine, which is the problem the rewrite removed.
