"""The AlphaZero pipeline: the leak boundary, the search, the buffer, and the checklist.

Section 21 of the design guide is a list of ten things to establish before a long run, and
most of this file is those ten written as assertions. They are cheap and they are the
difference between a run that failed and a run that was never going to work:

* deterministic with a fixed seed          :func:`test_generation_is_deterministic`
* legal action mask correct                :func:`test_search_never_returns_an_illegal_move`
* state tensor fixed shape                 :func:`test_replay_round_trips_a_real_observation`
* action ids stable                        ``tests/test_action_space.py`` already
* checkpoint save/load works               :func:`test_checkpoint_round_trips`
* self-play parallelism stable             :func:`test_parallel_pool_generates`
* no rendering or logging during training  :func:`test_generation_is_silent`

The first section is the one that matters most, and it is not on the guide's list because the
guide assumes perfect information. **Search must not see what the player may not see.**
:func:`test_determinize_ignores_hidden_state` holds this package to the same standard the
encoder and the heuristic are held to, using the same scrambler.
